Abstract from the relative project.

Stroke is an enormous global burden, six and a half-million people die from stroke annually.
Effectively monitoring blood hemodynamic parameters such as blood velocity and volume flow permits to help and cure people. 
This project aimed to calibrate a custom-made wearable system for measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) using a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor. 
The measurements were validated using Doppler ultrasound as a reference method. Five (N=5) subjects (age = 24±1.41 years) were selected for the project. 
The PPG and Doppler ultrasound probe were placed above the left and right common carotid arteries (CCA), respectively.
Measurements were taken simultaneously for 12 seconds each, with six consecutive measurements per subject and 2 time-synchronized ECG recordings. 
Subsequently, using an extraction algorithm the velocity envelope (TAMEAN) was extracted from the Doppler image to obtain the blood volume flow (ml/min). 
After synchronization, the PPG signal output expressed in volts was calibrated to the corresponding volume, and a calibration curve was created.
The extraction algorithm achieved remarkable results, with almost perfect correlation with the Doppler image reference, rTAMEAN=0.951 and rvolume=0.975 demonstrating its reliability. 
Challenges encountered during postprocessing and synchronization highlighted the need for careful refinement in the project framework. 
Despite successful signal processing and alignment techniques, calibration results were suboptimal due to synchronization difficulties and motion artifacts. 
Limitations included impractical measurement locations and susceptibility to movement artifacts. 
The calibration process did not yield the expected outcomes and the project aim was not achieved. 
All the linear regression models for each subject failed to accurately predict the volume flow based on the measured voltages. 
Future work could focus on refining calibration procedures, improving synchronization methods, and expanding studies to include larger cohorts. 
Although the wearable device was tested, the project’s goal was only partially achieved, underscoring the complexity of accurately measuring cerebral blood flow using PPG sensors.
